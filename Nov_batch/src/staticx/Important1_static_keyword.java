	/* static keyword can be applied for variables and methods
	 * 1.static variable
	 * 2.static method
	 * 3.non static variable
	 * 4.non static method 
	 * 
	 * NOTE :
	 *  as soon as object is created , 
	 * all the variables and methods will be acquired
	 * from the class
	 * 
	 * Assume all the employee belong to same department , 
	 * it means we have to assign for every object the 
	 * same department name
	 * 
	 *  any value that is same for all the objects, 
	 *  then we can hard code the value in the class itself and 
	 *  make that variable static 
	 *  
	 *  IMPORTANT POINTS 
	 *  1.static methods can directly access static variables and static methods without
	 *  creation of object
	 *  2.static methods can access non static variables and methods through object
	 *  3.objects are always created in main method
	 *  
	 *  */
